      <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.</p>
    <p>Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.</p>

    <header>Types of operating systems</header>
      <p>
        There are different types of operating systems, this includes;
        <li>Single-tasking and multi-tasking</li>
        <li>Single and multi-user</li>
        <li>Distributed</li>
        <li>Templated</li>
        <li>Real-time</li>
        <li>Embedded</li>
        <li>Library</li>
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Examples">
    <header>Examples</header>
      <p>
        The following are examples of operating systems:
        <code><li>Unix and Unix-like operating systems</li></code>
        <code><li>BSD and its descendants</li></code>
        <code><li>macOS</li></code>
        <code><li>Linus</li></code>
        <code><li>Microsoft Windows</li></code>

    <header>Components</header>
      <p>The components of an operating system all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work together. All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component.</p>
      <p>These components include: Kernel, Program execution, Interrupts, Modes, Memory management, Virtual memory, Multitasking, Disk access and file systems, Security, User interface, etc.</p>

    <header>Diversity of operating system and portability</header>
      <p>Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system, and sometimes even for specific hardware.[citation needed] When porting the application to run on another OS, the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS (the names of functions, meaning of arguments, etc.) requiring the application to be adapted, changed, or otherwise maintained.</p>
      <p>Unix was the first operating system not written in assembly language, making it very portable to systems different from its native PDP-11.</p>
      <p>This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms such as Java or Qt. These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their system libraries.</p>
      <p>Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards. For example, POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs.</p>
